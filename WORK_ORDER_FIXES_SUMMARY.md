# Work Order App Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Session Expiration Problems

**Issues Found:**
- Session expired during profile fetch: `Session expired during profile fetch - redirected to login page`
- Session expired during work order search: `Session expired during work order search`
- No automatic session recovery mechanism

**Fixes Implemented:**
- Added robust session validation before all API calls
- Implemented automatic session refresh mechanism in `enhanced_workorder_service.py`
- Added retry logic with fresh authentication for failed requests
- Enhanced session validation in work order detail route

### 2. Work Order Lookup Site Mismatch

**Issues Found:**
- Work orders found in site "LCVKWT" but lookup searching in site "LCVT"
- Work order details failing with "Work order not found" despite being visible in search results

**Fixes Implemented:**
- Modified `get_workorder_by_wonum()` to search across all accessible sites first
- Added fallback to user's default site if initial search fails
- Removed site restriction for initial work order lookup
- Enhanced logging to show which site the work order was found in

### 3. Authentication and Token Management

**Issues Found:**
- Token refresh mechanism not working properly
- Inadequate session validation
- Missing error handling for expired sessions

**Fixes Implemented:**
- Enhanced session validation with `is_session_valid()` checks
- Improved token refresh scheduling and execution
- Added session refresh retry logic in API calls
- Better cache management for authentication tokens

### 4. Task Retrieval Error Handling

**Issues Found:**
- No session validation before task API calls
- Poor error handling for HTML vs JSON responses
- Missing session expiration detection in task responses

**Fixes Implemented:**
- Added session validation before task API calls
- Enhanced error handling to detect HTML responses (indicating session expiry)
- Improved task response processing with better error messages
- Added graceful fallbacks for failed task retrieval

### 5. API Error Recovery

**Issues Found:**
- No retry mechanism for failed API calls
- Poor error handling for session expiration during API requests
- Missing automatic session refresh on API failures

**Fixes Implemented:**
- Added automatic session refresh and retry logic in `enhanced_workorder_service.py`
- Enhanced error detection for login redirects in API responses
- Improved logging for debugging API failures
- Added graceful degradation when API calls fail

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend/services/enhanced_workorder_service.py`
- Enhanced `get_workorder_by_wonum()` method to search across all sites
- Added session refresh and retry logic in search methods
- Improved error handling for session expiration

### 2. `app.py`
- Enhanced work order detail route with better session validation
- Improved task retrieval with session checks
- Added better error handling for session expiration
- Enhanced logging for debugging

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Login and Session Management:**
   - Test login with valid credentials
   - Verify session persistence across page navigation
   - Test session expiration handling

2. **Work Order Search:**
   - Search for work orders in different sites
   - Verify search results display correctly
   - Test pagination and filtering

3. **Work Order Details:**
   - Click on work order links from search results
   - Verify work order details load correctly
   - Test task retrieval and display

4. **Material Request Functionality:**
   - Test material request features
   - Verify dropdown functionality
   - Test storeroom integration

## Performance Improvements

- Reduced unnecessary API calls through better caching
- Improved session validation efficiency
- Enhanced error recovery reduces user disruption
- Better logging for debugging and monitoring

## Security Enhancements

- Improved session validation prevents unauthorized access
- Better token management reduces security risks
- Enhanced error handling prevents information leakage
- Automatic session refresh maintains security boundaries

## Monitoring and Debugging

- Enhanced logging provides better visibility into issues
- Improved error messages help with troubleshooting
- Performance metrics help identify bottlenecks
- Session validation logs help track authentication issues
